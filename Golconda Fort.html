        <p>Golconda is a fortified citadel and ruined city located on the western
         outskirts of Hyderabad, Telangana, India.The fort was originally built by
         Kakatiya ruler Pratāparudra in the 11th century out of mud walls.It was
         ceded to the Bahmani Kings from Musunuri Nayakas during the reign of the
         Bahmani Sultan Mohammed Shah I, during the first Bahmani-Vijayanagar War.
         Following the death of Sultan Mahmood Shah, the Sultanate disintegrated 
         and Sultan Quli, who had been appointed as the Governor of Hyderabad by 
         the Bahmani Kings, fortified the city and made it the capital of the
         Golconda Sultanate. Because of the vicinity of diamond mines, especially
         Kollur Mine, Golconda flourished as a trade centre of large diamonds known
         as Golconda Diamonds. Golconda fort is currently abandoned and in ruins.
         The complex was put by UNESCO on its "tentative list" to become a World
         Heritage Site in 2014, with other forts in the region, under the name
         Monuments and Forts of the Deccan Sultanate (despite there being a number 
         of different sultanates).The origins of the Golconda fort can be traced
         back to the 11th century. It was originally a small mud fort built by 
         Pratāparudra of the Kakatiya Empire. The name Golconda is thought to
         originate from Telugu for "Cowherd's hill" It is also thought that
         Kakatiya ruler Ganapatideva 1199–1262 built a stone hilltop outpost
         — later known as Golconda fort — to defend their western region. The 
         fort was later developed into a fortified citadel in 1518 by Sultan Quli
         of the Qutb Shahi Empire and the city was declared the capital of the 
         Golconda Sultanate.The Bahmani kings took possession of the fort after 
         it was made over to them by means of a sanad by the Rajah of Warangal.
         Under the Bahmani Sultanate, Golconda slowly rose to prominence. Sultan
         Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk (r. 1487–1543), sent by the Bahmanids as a governor
         at Golconda, established the city as the seat of his governance around
         1501. Bahmani rule gradually weakened during this period, and Sultan
         Quli (Quli Qutub Shah period) formally became independent in 1518,
        establishing the Qutb Shahi dynasty based in Golconda. Over a period
         of 62 years, the mud fort was expanded by the first three Qutb Shahi 
         sultans into the present structure: a massive fortification of granite
         extending around 5 km (3.1 mi) in circumference. It remained the capital
         of the Qutb Shahi dynasty until 1590 when the capital was shifted to
         Hyderabad. The Qutb Shahis expanded the fort, whose 7 km (4.3 mi) outer
        wall enclosed the city.</p>
