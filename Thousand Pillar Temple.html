        <p>Many Hindu temples were developed under the patronage of Ganapati Deva,
        Rudrama Devi and Prataparudra who were of Kakatiya dynasty.
        The Thousand Pillar Temple was believed to be constructed during the period
        between 1175–1324 CE by order of the king, Rudra Deva. It stands out to be
         a masterpiece and achieved major heights in terms of architectural skills
         by the ancient Kakatiya Vishwakarma Sthapathis (Architect). The Executive
         officer of the subject temple is P.Venugopal Gr-II he has brought lot of 
        changes in administration and development of temple.It was desecrated by the
        Tughlaq dynasty during their invasion of the Deccan.
        The Thousand Pillar Temple with its ruins lies near the Hanamkonda-Warangal
        Highway in Telangana State, about 150 kilometres (93 mi) from the city of 
        Hyderabad.
        Rudreswara Temple locally known as Veyisthambala Gudi (Thousand pillars temple)
         is one of the fine and earliest available examples of Kakatiya art, architecture
         and sculpture. It was built by Rudra Deva and named after him as ‘Sri Rudreswara
         Swamy temple with the presiding deity as Rudreswara, in 1163 CE in the style of
         later Chalukyan and early Kakatiyan Architecture, star-shaped and triple shrined 
         (Trikutalaya). The temple is a fine specimen of architecture and sculpture with
         One thousand pillars. There are richly carved pillars, perforated screens,
         exquisite icons, rock cut elephants and the monolithic dolerite Nandi as 
         components of the temple. Strengthening of foundations like sandbox technique,
         the skill of Kakatiya sculptors is manifest in adroit craftsmanship and flawless
         ivory carving technique in their art. The ingenuity of Kakatiya sculptors is
         visible in likes of lathe turned, and shiny polish in dolerite and granite stone 
         sculpture and craftwork of Nava Rangamandapa.
         The temple was renovated in 2004 by the Government of India. Archaeological
         Survey of India and modern engineers have been working for the temple's further
         renovation.[citation needed]</p>
