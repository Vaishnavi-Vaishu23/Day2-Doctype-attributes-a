        <p>The Qutub Shahi Tombs are located in the Ibrahim Bagh (garden precinct), close to
         the famous Golconda Fort in Hyderabad, India. They contain the tombs and mosques
         built by the various kings of the Qutub Shahi dynasty.
         The galleries of the smaller tombs are of a single storey while the larger ones are
         two-storied. In the centre of each tomb is a sarcophagus which overlies the actual
         burial vault in a crypt below. The domes were originally overlaid with blue and green
         tiles, of which only a few pieces now remain.
         The complex was put by UNESCO on its "tentative list" to become a World Heritage Site
         in 2014, with others in the region, under the name Monuments and Forts of the Deccan
         Sultanate (despite there being a number of different sultanates).
         The tombs form a large cluster and stand on a raised platform.
         They are domed structures built on a square base surrounded by pointed arches, a
         distinctive style that blends Persian and Indian forms. The tombs are structures 
         with intricately carved stonework and are surrounded by landscaped gardens.
         The tombs were once furnished with carpets, chandeliers, and velvet canopies
         on silver poles. Copies of the Quran were kept on pedestals and readers recited
         verses from the holy book at regular intervals.
         Golden spires were fitted over the tombs of the sultans to distinguish their tombs
         from those of other members of the royal families.
         During the Qutb Shahi period, these tombs were held in great veneration.
         In 1687, during the Siege of Golconda, the tombs were converted into barracks by the
         invading Mughal army, and the grounds were turned into a camp.
         Guns were mounted on the mausoleums in order to bomb the fortress.The tombs fell into
         disrepair until Sir Salar Jung III ordered their restoration in the early 19th century.
         A garden was laid out, and a compound wall was built. Once again, the tomb garden of
         the Qutb Shahi family became a place of serene beauty. All except the last of the
         Qutb Shahi sultans lie buried here.</p>
