        <p>The Charminar is a monument located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India.
        Constructed in 1591, the landmark is a symbol of Hyderabad and officially
        incorporated in the emblem of Telangana.The Charminar's long history includes
        the existence of a mosque on its top floor for more than 425 years. While both
         historically and religiously significant, it is also known for its popular and 
         busy local markets surrounding the structure, and has become one of the most
         frequented tourist attractions in Hyderabad. Charminar is also a site of numerous
         festival celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha and Eid al-Fitr, as it is adjacent to
         the city's main mosque, the Makkah Masjid.The Charminar is situated on the east
         bank of Musi River.To the west lies the Laad Bazaar, and to the southwest the
         richly ornamented Makkah Masjid. It is listed as an archaeological and
         architectural treasure on the official list of monuments prepared by the
         Archaeological Survey of India.The English name is a translation and combination
          of the Urdu words chār and minar, translating to "Four Pillars"; the towers are
         ornate minarets attached and supported by four grand arches.The Archaeological
         Survey of India (ASI), the current caretaker of the structure, mentions in its
         records, "There are various theories regarding the purpose for which Charminar
         was constructed. However, it is widely accepted that Charminar was built at the 
         centre of the city, to commemorate the eradication of plague", a deadly disease
        which was widespread at that time.According to Jean de Thévenot, a French traveller
         of the 17th century whose narration was complemented with the available Persiar
         texts, the Charminar was constructed in the year 1591 CE, to commemorate the
         beginning of the second Islamic millennium year (1000 AH). The event was celebrated
         far and wide in the Islamic world, thus Qutb Shah founded the city of Hyderabad to 
         celebrate the event and commemorate it with the construction of this building.The
         Charminar was constructed at the intersection of the historical trade route that
         connects the city to international markets through the port city of Machilipatnam.
        : 195  The Old City of Hyderabad was designed with Charminar as its centrepiece. 
        The city was spread around the Charminar in four different quadrants and chambers, 
        segregated according to the established settlements. Towards the north of Charminar 
        is the Char Kaman, or four gateways, constructed in the cardinal direction.
        : 170  Additional eminent architects from Persia were also invited to develop the
         city plan. The structure itself was intended to serve as a mosque and madrasa.
         It is of Indo-Islamic architecture style, incorporating Persian architectural
         elements. A sample of Charminar is said to have been created at Dabirpura/Nagaboli
        graveyard before the actual construction</p>
